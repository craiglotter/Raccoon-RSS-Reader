Raccoon-RSS-Reader
==================

Raccoon RSS Reader is a simple RSS Feed Reader which allows the user to list a number of RSS feeds they wish to track. The RSS Feed XML is downloaded by the application and converted to an HTML format which is then displayed using its local CSS stylesheet (which can be edited by the user as required). The RSS feeds have a 30 minute cache.  Created by Craig Lotter, September 2006
